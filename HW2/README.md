## Changes in this iteration
No big changes are made in the program going from Java to Python. Python does not have a default abstract class type by default so we mimicked the abstract class functionality by using pass to have the super class method "do nothing". This method is then overridden in subclasses to implement polymorphism.

## Instructions to run
We built this program on Python 3.6.3 and assume that you have Python 3 or a later version installed.

First is to download the file from the repository onto a local folder on your machine.

Then in a command terminal, run the command to build and run the python file

```
python ooad_hw2.py
```
